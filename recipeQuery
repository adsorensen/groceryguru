I was able to purchase nice large avocados.  Here are the adaptations I made: I added cayenne pepper instead of cumin;  used 2 cloves of garlic; used 1/2 cup fresh cilantro; 2 jalapenos ; the juice from 2 limes. If preferred, you can bake the patties in a 400 degree oven for 15-20 minutes.  They will be less crispy on the edges if you choose this method.To prepare these vegan, replace the egg with a flax egg or chia egg (mix 1 Tbs. of either seed with 3 Tbs. warm water; let sit for 5 minutes and then mix in as you would an egg.)The patties can be made ahead of time and stored in the refrigerator for a couple of days; or frozen for a couple of months.','1','https://spoonacular.com/recipeImages/black-bean-burgers-552521.jpg',6,30,500.15,21.33,4.14,65.01,8.57,0,1197.89,17.14);
