Combine the rice and 3 1/4 cups water in a rice cooker and cook according to the manufacturer\'s instructions. A rice cooker is the best way to get perfect sticky-firm rice, but if you don\'t have one, just use a saucepan. Fold in the vinegar. Combine the vinegar, sugar and 1 teaspoon salt in a saucepan over medium heat, stirring to dissolve the sugar. Transfer the cooked rice to a large wooden bowl (traditionally, a wooden tub). Drizzle a quarter of the vinegar mixture over a wooden spoon or spatula onto the rice. Fold the rice gently with the spoon to cool it and break up any clumps; be careful not to smash the grains. Fold in the remaining vinegar mixture and let the rice sit 5 minutes. Spread the rice.                          Cover a bamboo sushi mat with plastic wrap. Place a half nori sheet rough-side up on the mat. Moisten your hands and scoop a handful of rice, slightly larger than a lemon, onto the nori. Press the rice to spread it evenly up to the edges of the nori, moistening your fingers as you go. Sprinkle with sesame seeds.                          Prepare the vegetables. Peel the cucumber and slice into matchsticks. (Morimoto cuts the entire cucumber into a paper-thin sheet, then quickly slices it into strips-but he\'s had some practice.) Thinly slice the avocado, tomato and red onion; peel the tough ends of the asparagus. Add the filling. Carefully flip over the nori so it\'s rice-side down on the mat with the short end facing you. Spread a bit of wasabi paste in a line about one-third of the way up the nori-it\'s spicy, so use it sparingly. Arrange a few pieces each of lettuce, cucumber, avocado, tomato and onion in a tight pile in the lower third of the sheet. It\'s OK if the vegetables hang over the edges of the nori. Roll the sushi. Roll the sushi away from you with your hands, tucking in the vegetables as you go. Remove the mat from under the roll and place it on top. Press the roll into a compact rectangular log, using the mat to help you. Slice the roll. Cut the sushi roll into 4 to 6 pieces. Repeat with the remaining nori, rice and vegetables. Serve with pickled ginger and more wasabi. Photography by Rick Lew','1','https://spoonacular.com/recipeImages/vegetable-sushi-319398.jpeg',20,80,191.75,5.7,0.83,31.33,2.75,0,198.49,4.45);

Make the Sushi Rice: Pour the rice into a fine-mesh strainer, large enough so you can freely toss and turn the grains. Have at hand a larger bowl into which the strainer can easily fit and fill it with cold tap water. Pour the rice into the strainer, then lower the strainer into the large bowl so that the water covers the rice. With both hands, gently rub, turn, and toss the rice. Do not press the grains too hard against the strainer or against one another, or the fragile grains may break. The water will instantly turn milky white, so remove the strainer from the large bowl, discard the water, and refill the bowl with fresh cold water. Return the rice-filled strainer to the bowl and repeat. On the second rinsing, the water will look only slightly milky. Repeat twice more. When you have finished, the water will be almost clear, but it will not reach 100% clarity. Drain the rice and let it sit in the strainer for 10 minutes.2. Transfer the rice to a heavy-bottomed pot that is deeper than it is wide and has a heavy, tightly fitting lid, add the water, and let it sit for 20 minutes.3. Set the rice over medium heat and cook, uncovered, until the water has nearly absorbed the rice, about 10 minutes. Quickly reduce the heat to very low, cover the pot with the lid, and cook until the rice is plump and cooked through, another 10 minutes. The rice should now be completely transparent. If you see any dry, very white-looking grains, sprinkle a little warm water over the dry spots and cook another couple of minutes or so over very low heat. During the cooking, never stir the rice.4. After confirming that all the rice grains are transparent, immediately put the lid back on before the built-up steam can escape. Turn off the heat and let the rice stand for 5 minutes.5. While the rice is cooking, put the rice vinegar, salt, and sugar in a bowl and stir with a whisk until the sugar and salt are almost dissolved.6. If you are using a wooden sushi tub and wooden paddle, soak them in a bath of cold water for half an hour while the rice is cooking. Drain the water and wipe the tub and paddle with a dry kitchen towel. Other bowls made of metal, glass, or porcelain can be substituted.7. Transfer the steaming hot cooked rice all at once to the bowl. Quickly and gently break up the rice, crisscrossing it with the side of your paddle. Pour the prepared vinegar dressing evenly over it and, with the paddle; break up the lumpy clumps and turn the rice over, working one area at a time. Repeat once or twice until you can tell by looking that the vinegar dressing is roughly distributed throughout the rice.8. Push the rice toward one side of the tub. Hold the paddle horizontally and rapidly move it back and forth with many small strokes. Work on the remaining areas of the rice one at a time in the same way, until you have moved all of the rice to the other side of the tub. Rotate the tub or bowl 180 degrees and repeat the process. The whole procedure should take about 2 minutes.9. With a hand fan or with a magazine or folded newspaper, fan the rice for about 30 seconds. Let the sushi rice cool to a temperature of 104 degrees F before using, covered with a moist kitchen cloth to prevent it from drying out.10. Make the California Rolls: Line up all the filling ingredients (crabmeat, cucumber, avocado, and sesame seeds) on a tray along with the sushi rice and half-sheets of nori, stacked up in a closed sealable plastic bag. Have at hand a small bowl containing 1 cup of cold water with 2 tablespoons of rice vinegar for moistening your hands and a moistened clean cloth. Open up your bamboo rolling mat and wrap it tightly in plastic wrap. Have a well-sharpened cutting knife at hand.11. Place one half-sheet of nori, shiny side down, on the rolling mat with a long side facing you. Moisten your hands slightly with the vinegar water and pick up the sushi rice (a little less than a cup - about the size of a baseball), forming into a roughly egg-shaped ball without squeezing. Place the rice ball on the nori, ½ inch from the upper far left edge of the nori. Spread the rice evenly to the right, leaving ½ inch of the far end of the upper end of the nori uncovered. Using your fingers, spread the rice towards you, until you have covered the whole area (except for the ½ inch at the top). Sprinkle the surface of the rice evenly with 1 tablespoon of white sesame seeds to form an outer coating for the roll.12. Flip the rice-covered nori sheet over onto the rolling mat, lining up the bottom edge of the mat and the nori sheet evenly. The nori is now on top of the rice. Arrange the crabmeat across the nori from left to right, one-quarter of the way up the side nearer you. Place two sticks of cucumber over the crabmeat and then two sticks of avocado on top of the cucumber sticks.13. To roll, lift up the bamboo mat near you and fold it over the fillings. As you roll and the bamboo mat reaches to the surface of the nori, pull back the edge of the bamboo mat (so that you do not roll it into the sushi) and continue to roll tightly until the whole roll is completed, leaving the seam down the roll. Now place the bamboo mat over the roll, hold it securely to firm it up, and square of the edges slightly. Unroll the rolling mat.14. To cut the roll into six equal pieces, first cut across the center with a sawing motion, not pushing down too hard, then cut each half-roll into thirds, wiping the blade of the knife with the moist cloth to remove the rice residue when necessary.Serve the rolls with a spicy mayonnaise, soy sauce, or wasabi. You can prepare this roll several hours in advance. For short-term storage, wrap each uncut roll in plastic wrap, put it in a sealable container, and store it in a cool, dry, dark place. Or for longer-term storage, refrigerate it in the vegetable bin.','1','https://spoonacular.com/recipeImages/California-Rolls-(including-Sushi-Rice)-508052.jpg',7,70,474.12,6.88,1.02,86.79,3.66,0,755.25,14.11);

Carefully squeeze the potato to make sure it is soft all the way through. If it is not, microwave longer, in one minute increments, until it is soft all the way through (mine took 8 minutes).Took cook it in the oven: heat the oven to 400 degrees and then bake the potato for 45-60 minutes, or until it is soft all the way through (either directly on the oven rack or on a baking sheet).While the sweet potato is cooling, prepare the rest of the ingredients. Place the frozen corn in a large bowl. Drain and rinse the black beans. Allow as much excess water to drain away as possible, and then add them to the bowl with the corn. Roughly chop the cilantro leaves and then add them to the bowl, along with half of the cornmeal (1/4 cup), garlic powder, cumin, and salt. Take one chipotle pepper out of the can, mince it, and then add it to the bowl along with about one teaspoon of the adobo sauce from the can.Once the sweet potato is cool enough to handle, scoop out the flesh and add it to the bowl with the rest of the ingredients. Stir everything together and then either use a potato masher or the back of a fork to slightly mash the beans. Cover and chill the mixture for 30 minutes to allow the cornmeal to absorb some of the moisture.Divide the sweet potato mixture into four (or six) portions and shape each into a patty, approximately  inch thick. Use the remaining  cup of cornmeal to coat the outside of the patties. This will provide a nice crunch to the burger.To cook the patties in a skillet, heat  tablespoon of vegetable oil in a heavy bottomed skillet over a medium flame. When the oil is hot (it should look wavy on the surface), add two of the patties. Cook for about 5 minutes on each side or until the patties are golden brown. Add more oil and cook the remaining two patties. Remember to turn the patties carefully as they are quite soft and can fall apart.OR...To cook the patties in the oven, Preheat the oven to 400 degrees. Line a baking sheet with foil and then coat lightly with non-stick spray. Place the patties on the foil and then spritz the top of the patties lightly with non-stick spray (this will help it crisp up). Bake for 25 minutes, or until the patties are heated through and the bottoms are golden brown.Spread one tablespoon of mayonnaise on each bun and top with a chipotle sweet potato patty. Slice the avocado and place  of the slices on top of each burger.

Drain and add to a heavy bottomed pot along with the water. Bring the pot to a boil, then cover with a lid and turn down the heat to low and set a timer for 15 minutes. When the timer goes off, turn off the stove and let the rice steam for another 10 minutes, dont open the lid during this time. In a small bowl, whisk the vinegar, sugar and salt together. When the rice is done, dump it into a large bowl and cover with the vinegar mixture. Using a large spatula and fan, fold the vinegar into the rice while cooling the mixture with the fan.  Keep fanning until the rice comes to room temperature. In a bowl, combine the minced toro with 3/4 of the scallions and the sesame seeds and stir to combine.  Prepare a small bowl of water to dip your fingers in to prevent the rice from sticking to them.Lay the nori, shiny side down on the bamboo matt. Wet your fingertips and lay down a thin layer of rice about 3/4 of the way up the nori. The rice will be sticky but just keep wetting your hands and gently press the rice outward with your fingertips to make it thin. Be careful not to overwork the rice or it will get mushy. Spoon some negitoro across the edge of the rice closest to you from one end to the other. Hook your thumbs below the bamboo mat and roll the edge up and over the filling. Dont squeeze the roll at this point or the negitoro wont stay in place. Continue rolling, being careful not to roll the mat along with the sushi. When you\'ve reached the end, give the roll a good squeeze from all around to set the shape of the rice. You should end up with a slightly square roll. Using a very sharp long knife (a sushi knife is ideal), score the roll at the midpoint, then score the middle of each half, then score the middle of each quarter (you should have 8 segments).','1','https://spoonacular.com/recipeImages/negitoro-sushi-2-8032.jpg',5,45,269.89,0.75,0.15,59.38,7.31,0,470.92,4.5);

Cut spaghetti squash in half lengthwise and scoop out seeds and membrane. Season with salt and bake about 1 hour, or longer if needed on a baking sheet, cut side up. If you prefer the microwave, cut squash in half lengthwise, scoop out seeds and fibers and place on a microwave safe dish and cover. Microwave 8-9 minutes or until soft. In a large deep saut pan, melt butter and add oil. Add onions, celery and carrots and saut on medium-low for about 3 to 4 minutes, until soft. Add the beef and season with salt. Brown the meat and cook, breaking it into smaller pieces with your spoon until cooked through. When cooked, add the tomatoes and adjust salt and pepper to taste. Add wine and simmer until it reduces a bit, then add bay leaf and cover, reducing heat to low. Simmer at least an hour, stirring occasionally. When spaghetti squash is cooked, let it cool for about 10 minutes. When cool, use a fork to remove flesh, which will come out in spaghetti looking strands. Keep covered and set aside keeping warm until sauce is ready. Serve topped with meat sauce and grated parmesan cheese, if desired.','1','https://spoonacular.com/recipeImages/spaghetti-squash-with-meat-ragu-933976.jpg',8,45,156.9,4.63,1.81,14.6,7.47,0,219.49,14.5);

Mince the garlic and saut it with butter in a deep skillet over medium heat for 1-2 minutes, or just until it\'s soft and fragrant (don\'t let it brown).Add the chicken broth, milk, fettuccine (I like to break it in half first), sun dried tomato pieces, and a healthy dose of freshly cracked pepper (15-20 cranks of a pepper mill) to the skillet. Make sure the pasta is submerged below the liquid.Place a lid on the pasta and allow the liquid in the skillet to come to a boil. Once it reaches a boil, give it a quick stir to make sure the pasta is not stuck to the bottom. Return the lid to the top, turn the heat down to low (or just above low), and let it simmer for about 10-12 minutes, or until the pasta is tender. Stir briefly every 4-5 minutes as it simmers to keep the pasta from sticking to the bottom of the skillet.If the pasta is still very soupy at that point, remove the lid and let it simmer for 3-5 minutes more, or until the sauce has reduced and thickened slightly. Once thickened, sprinkle the Parmesan over top and serve. The sauce will continue to thicken after the pasta is removed from the heat.','1','https://spoonacular.com/recipeImages/one-pot-creamy-sun-dried-tomato-pasta-934810.jpg',4,30,364.83,13.21,7.1,47.69,6.88,0,639.79,14.23);
